# BubbleSort-Algorith-Visualization

This is a program that randomly creates an array of 1000 integers and then proceeds to sort them. 
We can visualize it using the sfml library for c++. But in order for the program to run in your computer, the sfml library needs to be installed on your computer and then linked with the file.
